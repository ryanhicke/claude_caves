## Combat System Explained

### Turn-Based Combat
When you enter The Guardian's Lair, turn-based combat begins automatically:

1. **Guardian attacks first** each round (deals 1-8 damage)
2. **You attack second** each round
3. **Press Enter** to continue to the next round
4. Combat continues until someone reaches 0 HP

### Your Stats
- **Base HP**: 10
- **With Ancient Shield**: 15 HP (+5 bonus)
- **Bare hands damage**: 1-4 per hit
- **With Shiny Dagger**: 2-16 per hit

### Guardian Stats
- **HP**: 20
- **Damage**: 1-8 per hit
- **Attacks first** every round

### Combat Example
```
ROUND 1
⚔️  The Guardian attacks with his sword!
   The Guardian deals 5 damage!
   Your HP: 10/15

🗡️  You strike with your shiny dagger!
   You deal 12 damage!
   Guardian HP: 8/20

[Press Enter to continue to next round...]
```

### Why You Need Both Items

**Without Dagger (1-4 damage)**:
- Average 2.5 damage per hit
- Need ~8 hits to defeat guardian
- Guardian needs 2-10 hits to defeat you
- **Very likely to lose**

**With Dagger Only (2-16 damage)**:
- Average 9 damage per hit
- Need ~3 hits to defeat guardian  
- You have 10 HP, guardian does 1-8 damage
- **Possible to win, but risky**

**With Dagger + Shield (2-16 damage, 15 HP)**:
- Average 9 damage per hit
- Need ~3 hits to defeat guardian
- You have 15 HP, much more survivability
- **Best chance of victory!**
